Intertwined adds the ability to edit the same story and passages across multiple users, making it easier to collaboratively work on stories together with the hopes of making Intertwined/Twine easier to use in a classroom setting for Computer Science education.

There are also still some bugs related to concurrency that need to be ironed out, and stories, groups, and passages may be deleted at any time. Please back up your work frequently offline by Archiving your story.</p><p> The overall objective of Intertwined is to inspire larger teams and institutions to invest in collaborative storymaking tools that use HTML/CSS/Javascript/some kind of computer programming language to enhance computer science education.</p> <p> If you would like to use this as a tool in your classroom, consider building and deploying your own version of Intertwined! There is a comprehensive tutorial for doing so on the <a href=\"https://github.com/iiwasaki/intertwined\"> Intertwined repository</a> (Scroll down and you will eventually find it)!

There may be some features missing in Intertwined that Twine has, but those should be nothing too major and are few and far between.</p><p> The most important difference is that stories are now saved on the web and can be worked on by multiple people.</p> <p>Stories all belong to 'Groups' now in a shared <strong>group library</strong>, and anyone can make a group and invite others to it using the group name and a passcode. Stories made within a group can be seen and edited by anyone that has connected to the group. To add new groups, change the active group, or synchronize group libraries, please click on the \"Library\" tab in the main menu. Passcodes are meant to be shared to those who you want to invite to participate in your group, so please do not use your real passwords for that. While passcodes provide a base level of security, total security cannot be guaranteed; please do <strong>NOT</strong> put any confidential or sensitive information in your stories.</p> <p> As this is still in active development and meant to be used only for testing, please make sure to download and back up stories by using the Archive function to avoid losing too much data.</p> ",
