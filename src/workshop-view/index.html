        <p>If you encounter any bugs during the workshop, please send them to iwasaki@wwu.edu. The transition from the single-user Twine to the collaborative Twine has created many issues and not all of them are squashed yet, so please let me know!</p>
        <h2 ref="info">Twine Information</h2>
        <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> is an open-source (a.k.a free to use and tweak) tool for creating interactive, branching-narrative stories created by Chris Klimas. It requires little to no prior coding experience, and the stories created from it can be viewed by anyone with a web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.</p>
        <p>Twine has lots of potential in an educational setting, from teachers creating stories that students must navigate through to students creating their own stories (and therefore demonstrating mastery of a concept in doing so). Research into interactive narratives as a teaching tool shows that it is an effective tool at teaching students concepts that don't have a clear-cut answer, such as topics dealing with ethics where context is very important.</p>
        <p>While Twine is a fantastic tool for story development, it does not offer a simple solution for collaboration on a project. Stories are built on local machines, and sharing stories involves a back and forth of exporting and importing stories between authors. Multiple people can work on a story together by editing the story narrative script on a platform such as Google Docs and then having one person be the designated "coder" that translates the story structure to the Twine editor, but that is not an ideal structure for collaboration in a classroom where all students should be given the opportunity to code.</p>
        <p>Intertwined, the modified version of Twine for this workshop, takes the original Twine and hooks it up to an online database that serves as a central server for all of the stories. In doing so, we allow for real-time collaboration for working on a Twine story. The workflow and markup language used in Intertwined is the exact same as Twine, and users experienced with Twine will feel almost no difference other than the fact that somebody else may start writing in your editor.</p>

        <h2 ref="examples">Twine Story Examples</h2>
        <p>Before we dive into exactly what Twine does, let’s look at some examples of stories made with Twine. Twine has the flexibility to create all kinds of stories, ranging from a short story to a complex, branching narrative filled with twists, turns, and interactive challenges for the player. Here are some examples that other Twine storytellers have made. You do not have to play through these to completion; this is just to give you an idea of what is possible using Twine. One note to make is that while these stories are primarily built with Twine, there are additional Javascript and CSS code attached to them to make them look and behave in a more game-like way.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Depression Quest</a>: An award-winning game that simulates life as someone living with depression.</li>
            <li><a href="https://carolinehardin.github.io/DigitalPrivacyDetectives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Privacy Detectives</a>: An interactive story created by Dr. Caroline Hardin (one of the presenters of this workshop!) that explores the scenario where your best friend has an embarrassing photo of them emailed to everyone in their social circle. Designed to be used by teachers to encourage students to think critically about digital privacy from the social lens. </li>
            <li><a href="https://philome.la/PixelArtsPublic/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portland Public School 7th Grade Story Collection</a>: A collection of stories that 7th graders made in a couple of hours as part of a Portland Public Schools program. There are lots of "meme" stories, but some are relatively clever and insightful!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend playing through a couple of stories (you don't have to complete them) to get an idea of what Twine stories feel like. The 7th graders' stories are the best examples for what can be done with the tools just built in to Twine without additional Javascript/CSS experience.</p>
        <h2 ref="twine_started">Twine: Getting Started</h2>
        <p>If you are looking for a comprehensive guide on the syntax used for Twine, the <a href="https://twinery.org/cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twine 2 Cookbook</a> is probably the best resource for you. It can be accessed at <a href="https://twinery.org/cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twinery.org/cookbook</a>. It is possible that some of the features described in the Cookbook do not work due to the features having been broken during the translation from the original Twine to Intertwined. In that case, please send a bug report to Ishin at iwasaki@wwu.edu.</p>
        <p>The rest of this document will be a refresher from the content explained in Day 1 of the workshop series on getting started with Twine. This will assume that we are working on this story alone. For this tutorial, we are going to pretend that we are a middle school math teacher trying to create a mystery story where the student must use some math to get to the end of the story.</p>
        <p>If you have not already made a new story, click on the green "+ Story" icon on the toolbar on the right hand side of the main story screen. If you want to work on a story that already exists, you can click on the story directly to be taken to the editing screen.</p>
