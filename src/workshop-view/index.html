        <p>If you encounter any bugs during the workshop, please send them to iwasaki@wwu.edu. The transition from the single-user Twine to the collaborative Twine has created many issues and not all of them are squashed yet, so please let me know!</p>
        <h2 ref="info">Twine Information</h2>
        <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> is an open-source (a.k.a free to use and tweak) tool for creating interactive, branching-narrative stories created by Chris Klimas. It requires little to no prior coding experience, and the stories created from it can be viewed by anyone with a web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.</p>
        <p>Twine has lots of potential in an educational setting, from teachers creating stories that students must navigate through to students creating their own stories (and therefore demonstrating mastery of a concept in doing so). Research into interactive narratives as a teaching tool shows that it is an effective tool at teaching students concepts that don't have a clear-cut answer, such as topics dealing with ethics where context is very important.</p>
        <p>While Twine is a fantastic tool for story development, it does not offer a simple solution for collaboration on a project. Stories are built on local machines, and sharing stories involves a back and forth of exporting and importing stories between authors. Multiple people can work on a story together by editing the story narrative script on a platform such as Google Docs and then having one person be the designated "coder" that translates the story structure to the Twine editor, but that is not an ideal structure for collaboration in a classroom where all students should be given the opportunity to code.</p>
        <p>Intertwined, the modified version of Twine for this workshop, takes the original Twine and hooks it up to an online database that serves as a central server for all of the stories. In doing so, we allow for real-time collaboration for working on a Twine story. The workflow and markup language used in Intertwined is the exact same as Twine, and users experienced with Twine will feel almost no difference other than the fact that somebody else may start writing in your editor.</p>
