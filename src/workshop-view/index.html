        <h2 ref="updates">New Updates</h2>
        <p>Any updates (potential changes to the app, group changes, etc.) will be posted here.</p>
        <p> Update 7/18: For this week and next, try to give users more agency and interactivity in the story by taking in user input! Use the "Input..." tab on the toolbar, or see the section below on getting user input.</p>
        <p>Known bugs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visiting the editor view directly with a link with the story ID (or refreshing the passage editor view page) will result in a blank screen. Workaround: you must enter from the start of the application (https://yellow-smoke-0ebd1751e.azurestaticapps.net/) and navigate to your story manually. </li>
            <li>Editing a passage title and creating new links in the passage at the same time will not create the new links once you exit the passage editor. Workaround: after exiting, manually create the new passages with the "+ Passage" button and change the names of the new passages to match.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 ref="reports">Bug Reports</h2>
        <p>If you encounter any bugs during the workshop, please send them to iwasaki@wwu.edu. The transition from the single-user Twine to the collaborative Twine has created many issues and not all of them are squashed yet, so please let me know!</p>
        <h2 ref="info">Twine Information</h2>
        <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> is an open-source (a.k.a free to use and tweak) tool for creating interactive, branching-narrative stories created by Chris Klimas. It requires little to no prior coding experience, and the stories created from it can be viewed by anyone with a web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.</p>
        <p>Twine has lots of potential in an educational setting, from teachers creating stories that students must navigate through to students creating their own stories (and therefore demonstrating mastery of a concept in doing so). Research into interactive narratives as a teaching tool shows that it is an effective tool at teaching students concepts that don't have a clear-cut answer, such as topics dealing with ethics where context is very important.</p>
        <p>While Twine is a fantastic tool for story development, it does not offer a simple solution for collaboration on a project. Stories are built on local machines, and sharing stories involves a back and forth of exporting and importing stories between authors. Multiple people can work on a story together by editing the story narrative script on a platform such as Google Docs and then having one person be the designated "coder" that translates the story structure to the Twine editor, but that is not an ideal structure for collaboration in a classroom where all students should be given the opportunity to code.</p>
        <p>Intertwined, the modified version of Twine for this workshop, takes the original Twine and hooks it up to an online database that serves as a central server for all of the stories. In doing so, we allow for real-time collaboration for working on a Twine story. The workflow and markup language used in Intertwined is the exact same as Twine, and users experienced with Twine will feel almost no difference other than the fact that somebody else may start writing in your editor.</p>

        <h2 ref="examples">Twine Story Examples</h2>
        <p>Before we dive into exactly what Twine does, let’s look at some examples of stories made with Twine. Twine has the flexibility to create all kinds of stories, ranging from a short story to a complex, branching narrative filled with twists, turns, and interactive challenges for the player. Here are some examples that other Twine storytellers have made. You do not have to play through these to completion; this is just to give you an idea of what is possible using Twine. One note to make is that while these stories are primarily built with Twine, there are additional Javascript and CSS code attached to them to make them look and behave in a more game-like way.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Depression Quest</a>: An award-winning game that simulates life as someone living with depression.</li>
            <li><a href="https://carolinehardin.github.io/DigitalPrivacyDetectives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Privacy Detectives</a>: An interactive story created by Dr. Caroline Hardin (one of the presenters of this workshop!) that explores the scenario where your best friend has an embarrassing photo of them emailed to everyone in their social circle. Designed to be used by teachers to encourage students to think critically about digital privacy from the social lens. </li>
            <li><a href="https://philome.la/PixelArtsPublic/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portland Public School 7th Grade Story Collection</a>: A collection of stories that 7th graders made in a couple of hours as part of a Portland Public Schools program. There are lots of "meme" stories, but some are relatively clever and insightful!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend playing through a couple of stories (you don't have to complete them) to get an idea of what Twine stories feel like. The 7th graders' stories are the best examples for what can be done with the tools just built in to Twine without additional Javascript/CSS experience.</p>
        <h2 ref="twine_started">Twine: Getting Started</h2>
        <p>If you are looking for a comprehensive guide on the syntax used for Twine, the <a href="https://twinery.org/cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twine 2 Cookbook</a> is probably the best resource for you. It can be accessed at <a href="https://twinery.org/cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twinery.org/cookbook</a>. It is possible that some of the features described in the Cookbook do not work due to the features having been broken during the translation from the original Twine to Intertwined. In that case, please send a bug report to Ishin at iwasaki@wwu.edu.</p>
        <p>The rest of this document will be a refresher from the content explained in Day 1 of the workshop series on getting started with Twine. This will assume that we are working on this story alone. For this tutorial, we are going to pretend that we are going to create a simple story about an adventurer in a castle.</p>
        <p>If you have not already made a new story, click on the green "+ Story" icon on the toolbar on the right hand side of the main story screen. If you want to work on a story that already exists, you can click on the story directly to be taken to the editing screen.</p>
        <img :src="'rsrc/img/01started.png'" alt="Green start button highlighted on main Twine screen"></img>
        <p>After giving your story a name, your story will appear in the list of stories. You can perform operations on the story by clicking on the cog icon under your story, such as playing your story, publishing your story as a .html file (and saving it for all eternity), or deleting your story. Clicking on the story will take you to the passage editor view.</p>
        <h2 ref="twine_passage">Twine: Passage Essentials</h2>
        <p>Twine stories are organized in Passages. Each Passage is a “page” of your story. Passages connect to each other in order to create the narrative flow.</p>
        <p>Let's edit our first passage, the "Untitled Passage", by double-clicking on the passage itself or hovering your mouse over the passage and clicking on the pencil icon to edit it.</p>
        <p>You will write the text of your story – along with the Twine “code” to make your story interactive and stylized – in this large text box. Text can be written just like in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. We will erase the default text and replace it with the opening of our story: “You find yourself in the entrance hall of an old castle. There is a key on the floor in front of you.” </p>
        <p>What you type in the editor will be saved to the passage once you exit the editor, either by clicking on the "x", pushing the "ESC" key on your keyboard, or clicking on the screen outside of the editor. If we exit our passage and play our story, we will see that our opening story is indeed there!</p>
        <p>Let's move on to a different page and give our reader a choice to make this a truly interactive piece of fiction. We left our story with a prompt about a key on the floor. Let's give our reader the choice to pick up the key or leave it where it is.</p>
        <p>Open up the passage editor again; this time, we are going to create a <b>link</b> to a new passage. Links will advance the reader to different pages. To create a link, we will use [[ ]] (double brackets) to do so. In our editor, under the last line about the key, we are going to insert two new lines.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>[[Pick up the key. -> Get Key]]</li>
            <li>[[Do not pick up the key. -> No Key]]</li>
        </ul>
        <img :src="'rsrc/img/02keys.png'" alt="Twine editor of Untitled Passage"></img>
        <p>Close out of the passage editor, and Twine should have made two new passages for you: one titled "Get Key", and another titled "No Key". There should be an arrow from the first "Untitled Passage" to each of the new passages. (If there isn't, that's okay! There are some bugs to be worked out for Intertwined. Click on the "+ Passage" button at the bottom right of the page, and rename that passage to be the title of the passage either "Get Key" or "No Key", whichever one is missing.)</p>
        <img :src="'rsrc/img/03passages.png'" alt="Twine story edit view with three passages"></img>
        <p>The link syntax is as follows: [["Text that will show up on the screen" -> "Name of the passage we are going to"]]. In our examples above, we had the statement "Pick up the key" go to a passage called "Get Key". You can also do something like [[Get Key]] without the arrow; in this case, the text "Get Key" will show up on the screen and it will go to a passage titled "Get Key".</p>
        <p>Inter-passage links are determined by the passage name, and capitalization matters!</p>
        <p>Other essentials to know about the Twine editor are the various options for styling your story. Bold, italics, strikethrough, and superscripts can be done through the toolbar options or the markup language.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>''Text surrounded by two apostrophes (not to be confused by a quotation mark) will show up bold.''</li>
            <li>//Text surrounded by backslashes will show up italicized.//</li>
            <li>^^Text surrounded by two carets will show up as superscript.^^</li>
            <li>~~Text surrounded by two tildes will show up with a strikethrough.~~</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The toolbar makes it so that you do not have to remember a lot of the text commands; feel free to explore with the other text commands, or consult the <a href="https://twinery.org/cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twine 2 Cookbook</a> for more details.</p>
        <p>You’ve probably heard the phrase “Test early; test often” before. Twine stories are no exception! To make sure that everything is showing up as we like, we can test and play our story at any time.  </p>
        <p>On the bottom right of your window, you should see the “Play” button and the “Test” button. They both do similar things, with “Test” giving you a bit more of a “behind-the-scenes” look of your story. For now, let’s just click on “Play” and make sure that our story is working as intended for now.</p>
        <img :src="'rsrc/img/04playing.png'" alt="View of Twine story playing"></img>
        <p>Looking good! Let’s  give the user some agency now to make their own choices.</p>
        <h2 ref="twine_variables">Twine: Variables and If-Else</h2>
        <p>One way to enhance our story is to give it some ability to react to player choices beyond selecting a page. Variables can store all kinds of values and will allow the story to react to those variables. Generally speaking, variables have a story-wide scope; that is to say that variables will pass on from passage to passage.</p>
        <p>Variables can be used in tandem with If-Else statements that will show certain lines of text depending on certain conditions. This can really help keep our story organized. Let's see a practical example in action!</p>
        <p>In our story above, we had a user visit one passage if they wanted to pick up the key on the floor, and another passage if they wanted to leave the key on the floor as is. No matter which way the reader goes, we are going to have the reader head towards a door. We can make the door's behavior change depending on whether the user picked up the key or not!</p>
        <p>We are going to add the following lines to the <b>"Get Key"</b> passage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You pick up the key from the ground. It's a very ornate key with an intricate carving of an owl on the handle.</li>
            <li>(set: $got_key to "yes")</li>
            <li>[[Go to the door -> Door]]</li>
        </ul>
        <img :src="'rsrc/img/05getkey.png'" alt="Twine passage editor view with setting the got key variable"></img>
        <p>The first line is what the user will see when they get to the passage; a simple little description of their action. The second line, <b>(set: $got_key to "yes")</b>, is going to create a variable called "got_key" for our story, and it is going to have "got_key" hold the value "yes" inside of it. You can achieve the same result by clicking on the "Var..." button in the toolbar and filling in the appropriate lines. The third line continues our story.</p>
        <p>Let's do something similar to our <b>"No Key"</b> passage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You leave the key on the floor. After all, someone might have dropped it, and it would be rude to take something that doesn't belong to you.</li>
            <li>(set: $got_key to "no")</li>
            <li>[[Go to the door -> Door]]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this case, we are setting the value of "got_key" to "no". The dollar sign represents that we are storing "got_key" as a variable. If you use the "Test" button to test our story out now, you can keep track of the variables in your story as they are assigned.</p>
        <img :src="'rsrc/img/06test.png'" alt="Twine testing view showing the result of setting the got key variable"></img>
        <p>Notice that our third line here is the same as the third line in the "Get Key" passage! Regardless of whether or not we picked up the key, we are going to have the user walk to the door. We can make what happens at the "Door" passage change depending on our variable.</p>
        <p>Open up the "Door" passage in the editor. We are going to add the following lines: (As usual, you can also click on the "If..." button in the editor toolbar to achieve the same thing as below.)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(if:$got_key is "yes")[You walk to the door. The door is locked, but you use the key and open the door to find some treasure!]</li>
            <li>(else:)[You walk to the door. The door is locked, and you do not have a key to open it.]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The general format for If-Else statements is to have a parentheses that has the condition immediately followed by what you want to show the user in single brackets. In this case, if we had visited the "Get Key" passage and set our $got_key variable as "yes", then we will show the line about the door opening. If not, the other line will be shown! You can demonstrate this by playing your story and making sure it works.</p>
        <img :src="'rsrc/img/07ifelse.png'" alt="Twine testing view showing the result of the if-else block"></img>
        <p>There are lots of other If-Else conditionals you can make. Instead of remembering the text syntax for those, it's a lot easier to click on the "If..." button on the toolbar, fill out the necessary blank spaces, and click "Add" to have the Twine program insert it directly into your text box. </p>
        <h2 ref="twine_input">Twine: User Input</h2>
        <p>Getting user input can be a valuable tool for your story. User input can be used to personalize a story (for example, getting a reader's name and referring to the name in the story), give users more agency (giving them a list of items to take from a treasure chest), or even as a form of formative assessment, where the next part of the story is gated behind the student providing the correct answer to the story. </p>
        <p>The toolbar menu for getting user input can be opened by clicking on the "Input..." button in the passage editor toolbar.</p>
        <img :src="'rsrc/img/08input.png'" alt="Highlight of the Input button in the passage editor"></img>
        <p>There are several ways of getting user input that Twine supports. You can grab user input by: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Free text box</li>
            <li>Dropdown menu</li>
            <li>Checkbox</li>
            <li>A popup dialog box</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can customize the text box, dropdown menu, checkbox, or the dialog boxes according to the prompts shown on the screen. In order to save the user input, however, the checkbox at the bottom of the section for "Bind this input element to the variable ___" should be checked. The variable named typed in the input field there will be the name of the variable that the user input will be saved to. Click "Add" once all the fields are filled out, and the appropriate code will be added to your editor.</p>
        <p>From there, any time the user changes the input field in the story in any way - whether it's typing in new text, checking a different item in the checkbox, selecting a different item in the dropdown - the corresponding variable will be changed. You can check the exact value and behavior of the variable by going into the Test mode and looking at the variable in the passage. The variable will update in real time according to the user choices. </p>
        <p>There is an example story titled "Day 2: User Input Demo" that will have an example of how a text box can be used in a story.</p>
